	<p><strong>Running Tours Budapest</strong> was founded by young and enthusiastic Hungarian locals who have a passion for running and would like to share it. They wanted to develop a tourist experience that gets visitors out of the traffic jams and large tour groups and into the streets to see a more intimate and thriving Budapest. Who needs a beastly tour bus that can barely fit through narrow streets when we have our legs for transportation? And you do not even have to mind CO emission either! <strong>So put on your sneakers and let’s go for a run!</strong></p>
