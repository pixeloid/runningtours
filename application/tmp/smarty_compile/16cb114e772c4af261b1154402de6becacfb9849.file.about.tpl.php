They wanted to develop a tourist experience that gets visitors out of the traffic jams and large tour groups and into the streets to see a more intimate and thriving Budapest. Who needs a beastly tour bus that can barely fit through narrow streets when we have our legs for transportation? So put on your sneakers and let’s go for a run!
